## How did you get into programming?

- I programmed in Basic on Commodore 64 in the early 80s

- Until … just happened to walk past the UNIX lab at Loyola University in MD in 1994
- Saw people working on Digital DECStations with 20 inch monitors
- Switched major from accounting to computer science
- Never looked back

## How did Pillow come about?

- https://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-July/006423.html
- https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/35 (2013)
- https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3469 (late 2018)

## What are some lessons you’ve learned while creating and maintaining Pillow?

- Open source does not have to be stressful, Pillow is one of the least stressful open source projects I've ever worked on
- There is a tremendous need to "pay the maintainers" and as such I am now a Tidelift Lifter Advocate in addition to being a paid Lifter

## Are there any surprising use cases you have seen Pillow used for? Examples?

## Do you think AI will replace Pillow? Why or why not?

- No. I think AI can already write Python code that uses Pillow to do image processing. I think if prompted, AI could also write code for Pillow itself. Beyond that, I think AGI could have some impact on Pillow but I don't know what that looks like.
